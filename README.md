# Amplifier Circuit for Bio Signals Using BJTs
Continuous measurement of patient parameters such as heart rate and rhythm, respiratory rate, blood pressure, blood-oxygen saturation, and many other parameters have become a common feature of the care of critically ill patients. These parameters are known as bio signals. When accurate and immediate decision-making is crucial for effective patient care, electronic monitors frequently are used to collect and display physiological data. The electronic circuit for measurement must be designed specifically for these low voltage and low varying bio-signals. This paper proposes a design of bio- signal amplifier circuit to achieve a given transfer function whose inputs are temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen and respiratory rate.
